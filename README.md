# Emma-Interest

We're using Terra Luna's ecosystem of stable-coins (this includes stable-coins for countries like Thailand, South Korea, and Indonesia to name a few) to vastly improve the retail customer experience by offering much higher deposit APYs in their local currency. Beyond actually building the UI/UX in each country's local language (rare in a world where everything is in English and USD in DeFi), we will connect the Rust ecosystem of DeFi projects and yields. Deposits will be connected to Luna's Anchor Protocol, but Emma Interest will be built on Polkadot in order to assure security and multi-chain scalability. Deposits will be be collateralized across the ecosystem of Rust-built dApps, and users will be able to use Mirror Protocol to get stocks like Tesla and Amazon, and access to a derivatives market as Emma Interest can send user's UST to dApps likes of Acala on Polkadot.
